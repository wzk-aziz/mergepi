don't push on this branch 
only pull from it 
to be able to pull from the branch 

create a foalder on your computer in that foalder open git bash

using git bash :


clone the project using : 
```
git clone "link of the repository"
```
create your own branch :

```
 git branch new-branch-name
```
navigate to the branch :
```
git checkout new-branch-name
```

After creating a new branch and making changes to your project, you can push the project to the remote repository with the following steps:

Stage your changes. This adds the changes to the Git staging area:
```
git add .
```
Commit your changes. Replace Your commit message with a meaningful message describing the changes you made:
```
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```
Push your changes to the remote repository. Replace new-branch-name with the name of your new branch:
```
git push -u origin new-branch-name
```
The ```-u ``` option sets the upstream branch, so that in the future you can simply use git push and git pull without specifying the branch.
